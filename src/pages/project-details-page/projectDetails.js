    projectBackground: `As a self taught Developer the constant shift in the Frontend Paradigm was definitely the toughest pill to swallow.
		Having a realization that frameworks can come and go, but the basics of Web Fundamentals through HTML,CSS and JavaScript will always stack back is what inspired the project.

    projectBackground: `Let's be honest, we have all been there, trying to manage state in React and making sure we don't drill down our props down the component tree.

So yes to a single source of truth about store and let's "mapStateToProps" and "dispatch" actions around.`,
